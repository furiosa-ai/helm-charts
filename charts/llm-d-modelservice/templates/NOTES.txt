{{- if .Values.multinode }}
⚠️  WARNING: multinode=true enables LeaderWorkerSet (LWS), which is designed for
   coordinating pods across multiple nodes. However, Furiosa-LLM does not currently
   support KV cache transfer or PD disaggregation, making multi-node coordination
   ineffective.

   Consider setting multinode=false for more efficient LLM serving.
