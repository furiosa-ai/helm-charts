                                The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                                can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                Default value is 0.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                                number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                                can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                the update.

                                Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during the
                                update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total
                                number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                                number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                                up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                the update.

                                The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                                can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                Default value is 0.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                                number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                                This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0
                                Default value is 1.

                                can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                the update.

                            MaxUnavailable is the maximum number of nodes that can be unavailable (e.g., cordoned or upgrading) at any given time during the upgrade process.
                            This can be specified as an absolute number or a percentage of total nodes (for example, `3` or `"30%"`).
                            It places an additional constraint on MaxParallelUpgrades to ensure only the allowed portion of nodes are impacted.
